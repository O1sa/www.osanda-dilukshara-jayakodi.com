<h1>My Favourite Festival</h1>
<p> *My favourite festival is Vesak. It is in May. It is celebrated by Buddhists. For this festival we make Vesak lanterns. We observe sil. We go to the temple. We offer flowers to Lord Buddha. People make pandals. People give alms. I like the vesak festival.Vesak festival is a religious festival. It is celebrated during May, by Buddhists all over the world. On this day, all Buddhists go to the temple, offer flowers, light oil lamps, and worship the Buddha. Most of the Buddhists observe sil. Our whole family observes sil on this day.

We make beautiful Vesak lanterns. We light the oil lamps and Vesak buckets in the evening. Houses are decorated with Buddhist flags and streamers. It is very beautiful in the night. People go to see the pandals. Lots of people go on pilgrimages. Small children are very happy.

<h1>My Favourite Fruit</h1>
<p>*The mango is my favourite fruit. It is the fruit of the mango tree. It is liked not only by me but also by all the children and grown-up people.
 
The mango tree grows in hot countries such as Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and the East and West Indies. Of all kinds of mangoes of Bangladesh those of Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Bogra and Chapai Nawabgonj are the best and most famous for taste and flavour.
 
The mango blossoms in the months of Pous and Magh. Within a month or two, the fruits come out. They grow to their full size in two or three months and ripen in the month of Jaistha. Some mangoes ripen in the months of Ashar and Sraban. They grow in Rajshahi and Maldha and are called Fazli. These mangoes are big in size and very sweet to taste.
 
The mango has a thin skin all round its body. Below the skin these is a kernel and within the kernel there is the stone. The tree grows fromt he stone. When the fruit ripens, its kernel becomes juicy. Ripe mangoes turn red, become soft and taste sweet.
 
Mango is not only a tasty fruit but also a nutritious food. It fulfills the need of nutrition in our body and helps to keep our body fit. Thousands of people of our country are engaged in mango cultivation and trade. It also contributes a lot in our national economy.
 
The mango is a sweet fruit. It is called the king of fruits. Achar, Chatni, Morabba, and Amsatta are made from mangoes. All people, both children and grown-up people, are fond of eating mangoes. I like mango very much.
